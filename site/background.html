<div id="bg">“It’s a dream come true,” beamed Rai. “ I never imagined I would be in the top 10 of a WRC rally. Obviously we want to go to the end, there’s still a massive way to go,” 

“Once the big cars go through, it’s almost undriveable in places. But again, it’s Safari, and it’s the same for everyone. I’m just happy that the big boys are back,” he added.

Polish pilot Daniel Chwist was second in a Ford Fiesta Rally2. He was 1min 52.7sec ahead of former Junior WRC star Karan Patel, who completed the podium in a Fiesta R5.

Tundo eventually managed to end the day fourth following his off in SS4, but trailed the leaders by 7min 53.6sec. Aakif Virani rounded out the leaderboard 11min 01.3sec behind in a Škoda Fabia R5.
