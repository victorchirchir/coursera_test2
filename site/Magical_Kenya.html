<h1>MAGICAL KENYA</h1>
<h2>Your one stop holiday destination, from the big five to the small five.</h2>
<section>
	<article>In Kenya, you can have a magical experience every day.</article>
	<article>The incredible diversity of landscapes, cultures, wildlife and activities mean endless opportunities for visitors to Kenya. Kenya offers a diverse range of environments all within relatively close proximity to one another, and has an excellent domestic travel infrastructure. Kenya’s rich diversity of wildlife means that no two experiences in the wild are ever the same.</article>
	<article>Visitors to Kenya can experience and see completely different things. In a single trip to Kenya, you can visit tropical forests, beautiful beaches, and deserts, climb mountains and explore the wild. In Kenya, it is possible to plan a safari that blends adventure and relaxation, luxury and natural simplicity, social experiences and solitude.</article>

	<h3>Masai Mara National Reserve</h3>
	<article>The Masai Mara National Reserve is one of the top tourist attractions in Kenya and the country’s most popular game park.</article>
	<article>Each year the Masai Mara National Reserve is visited by thousands of tourists who come here to watch the exceptional population of game and the annual migration of zebra and wildebeest.

	<h3>Nairobi National Park</h3>
	<article>Nairobi National Park is just a 10 minutes drive from the city under the sun, Nairobi with only a fence separating the park’s wildlife from the metropolis. Nairobi’s skyscrapers can be seen from the park.</article>
	<article>Despite its proximity to the city and the relative small size of the park, Nairobi National Park boasts a large and varied wildlife population. Migrating wildebeest and zebra gather in the park during the dry season, and it is one of Kenya’s most successful rhinoceros sanctuaries.</article>

	<h3>Amboseli National Park</h3>
	<article>Crowned by Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest peak, Amboseli National Reserve is one of Kenya's most popular tourist parks. The name "Amboseli" comes from a Maasai word meaning "salty dust," an apt description for the park's parched conditions.</article>
	<article>The reserve is one of the best places in Africa to view large herds of elephants up close. Other wildlife commonly spotted in the park includes big cats, such as lion and cheetah, as well as giraffe, impala, eland, waterbuck, gazelle, and more than 600 species of birds.</article>
	<article>Nature lovers can explore five different habitats here, ranging from the dried-up bed of Lake Amboseli, wetlands with sulfur springs, savannah, and woodlands. Look for the local Maasai people who live in the area around the park.</article>

	<h3>Tsavo National Park</h3>
	<article>Kenya's largest park, Tsavo, is sliced in two: Tsavo West and Tsavo East. Together these parks comprise four percent of the country's total area and encompass rivers, waterfalls, savannah, volcanic hills, a massive lava-rock plateau, and an impressive diversity of wildlife.</article>
	<article>Midway between Nairobi and Mombasa, Tsavo East is famous for photo-worthy sightings of large elephant herds rolling and bathing in red dust. The palm-fringed Galana River twists through the park, providing excellent game viewing and a lush counterpoint to the arid plains.</article>
	<article>Other highlights here include the Yatta Plateau, the world's longest lava flow; Mudanda Rock; and the Lugard Falls, which spill into rapids and crocodile-filled pools.</article>
	<article>Tsavo West is wetter and topographically more varied, with some of the most beautiful scenery in the northern reaches of the park. Highlights here are Mzima Springs, a series of natural springs with large populations of hippos and crocodiles; Chaimu Crater, a great spot for seeing birds of prey; and Ngulia Rhino Sanctuary.</article>
	<article>Wildlife is not as easy to see in Tsavo West because of the denser vegetation, but the beautiful scenery more than compensate.</article>
