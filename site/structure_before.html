    <h1>Your one stop holiday destination, from the big five to the small five.</h1>
    <p>In Kenya, you can have a magical experience every day.

The incredible diversity of landscapes, cultures, wildlife and activities mean endless opportunities for visitors to Kenya. Kenya offers a diverse range of environments all within relatively close proximity to one another, and has an excellent domestic travel infrastructure. Kenya’s rich diversity of wildlife means that no two experiences in the wild are ever the same. Visitors to Kenya can experience and see completely different things. In a single trip to Kenya, you can visit tropical forests, beautiful beaches, and deserts, climb mountains and explore the wild. In Kenya, it is possible to plan a safari that blends adventure and relaxation, luxury and natural simplicity, social experiences and solitude.</p>
    <p>The Masai Mara National Reserve is one of the top tourist attractions in Kenya and the country’s most popular game park. Each year the Masai Mara National Reserve is visited by thousands of tourists who come here to watch the exceptional population of game and the annual migration of zebra and wildebeest. The Seventh World Wonder the “Great Migration” takes place every year from July to October when millions of wildebeest and zebra migrate from the Serengeti in Tanzania.</p>
