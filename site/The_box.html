<h1>Box Model</h1>

<div id="box">
  <div id="content">Rai, driving a Volkswagen Polo GTI R5, was fifth after Thursday afternoonâ€™s Super Special Kasarani curtain-raiser in Nairobi.. 

He soon turned the tables and moved into the lead after a storming time over Chui Lodge on Friday morning before steering clear of trouble on hardcore stages on the southern shore of Lake Naivasha.

Previous Safari winner Carl Tundo posed an early threat, but he crashed his Polo later in the day and Rai was able to pull clear. 

The 33-year-old ended the day seventh overall with a 2min 55.1sec advantage in WRC3.</div>
